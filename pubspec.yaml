  # To add assets to your package, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #  - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #  - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  #
  # For details regarding assets in packages, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  #
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # To add custom fonts to your package, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Trueno
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/TruenoBd.otf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/fonts/TruenoBdIt.otf
          weight: 700
          style: italic
        - asset: assets/fonts/TruenoLt.otf
          weight: 100
        - asset: assets/fonts/TruenoLtIt.otf
          weight: 100
          style: italic
        - asset: assets/fonts/TruenoRg.otf
